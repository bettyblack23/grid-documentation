## Action management

You can remove, cut and copy actions with a small menu under the three horizontal dots. When pasting actions, make sure they don't overlap. Sometimes it's best to remove the action from the same type before pasting.
In this example, the new red LED color configuration is copied to an other control element.

From Grid Editor version 1.2.18 onward you can merge Action Blocks into a single Code Block with just one click. This can help with trying to stay within the character limit, or just to make your workflow quicker.

As an example here you can see a basic Action Chain under a Button Event reduced to just one Code Block from a Local, MIDI and Intensity Block.
