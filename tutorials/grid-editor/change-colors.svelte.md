## Set custom color

Under the *init* event, you can set the LED colors in the *LED Color* action. 
By default the LED Color action uses variables to calculate the red-green-blue values.
These are defined in the Local Variables action block. Open it up, and change the **red**, **gre** and **blu** values to 255, 0, 0, for a full red color.
