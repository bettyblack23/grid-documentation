### print
  - **How:** `print(functions)`<!-- only return value of functions!!! -->
  - **What:** The `print` function outputs the values of functions between the parentheses in the debugger window, in the order you asked for them. If you're trying to print out multiple values you have to use `,` as a divider. 
  - **Example:** Inputting the `print(self:button_value())` in the Code Block will print each value change on a button press into the debugger window on the left.
