## Software Setup for Grid Editor

We are building the Grid Editor for Mac OS, Windows and Linux. Here you can find the respective guides and information.

### Mac OS

Grid Editor is a signed and notarized application with a valid developer ID issued by Apple Inc. Tested on High Sierra (10.13) and other versions are also being tested soon. Different versions may give an alert of **unidentified developer**, resulting in blocking the application from opening. This can be overridden by following this guide by Apple.

If this happens to you, please let us know. We do our best to make Grid Editor compatible with various mac OS. 

#### Download

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/intechstudio/grid-editor)](https://github.com/intechstudio/grid-editor/releases/latest)

- You will need the **grid_editor\_Setup-\{release number}.zip** file to be downloaded and unzipped.
- After unzipping move the **Grid Editor.app** to the *Applications* folder.
- Launch the app.

#### Update

Grid Editor has self-update functionality. This only works, if your mac OS validates the application on first download. If it fails to validate the app, the updates downloaded in the background are also failing in validation. We are still debugging how we can make sure that the user is notified on validation problems and is directed to proper solution when it comes to updating the app. Removing the previous app version and re-installing the newest release is always an option.

### Windows

Grid Editor is not a signed application in the beta release stage. Up until app signing, security warnings may appear. However, we have tested the application on Windows 10 extensively.

#### Download 

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/intechstudio/grid-editor)](https://github.com/intechstudio/grid-editor/releases/latest)

- You will need the **grid_editor\_Setup-\{release number}.exe** file to be downloaded and unzipped.
- Launch the downloaded **.exe** and start the installation process.
- Windows may show an application install security warning. Choose to run the app anyway.
- Launch the installed app.

#### Update 

Grid Editor has self-update functionality. We had no issues as of today with this functionality on Windows.

### Linux

More information coming soon.
