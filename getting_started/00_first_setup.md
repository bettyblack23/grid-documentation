Work in progress.

## Getting Started

Below you can find the first steps for Getting Started with Grid.

## Hardware Setup

Connect your Grid module(s) with the included USB-C cable in your Grid package.

Once a Grid module is connected it should show up as a MIDI device on your computer.

All MIDI inputs now can be configured either in the DAW software of choice or our configurator software the Grid Editor.

For access to USB-HID device functions, macros and more we strongly recommend installing Grid Editor and configuring your module(s) there.

## Firmware Setup

Your Grid module will most likely arrive with outdated firmware. But don't worry that's normal, since the Grid Firmware is updated frequently as the product is still in a state of beta. So when you get  your Grid to connect the first thing should be updating your Firmware to the current version.

When using Grid Editor you will get notified whenever your Grid modules firmware is out of date.

Beware, in-depth instructions below!

### Firmware Update Instructions
This document will walk you through the process of updating the firmware on your Grid MIDI controller. Please carefully read through this document beforehand in order to aviod making any mistakes.

 The process will not require any special tools, you will only need
 - A computer running Windows, Mac or Linux
 - The Grid controller you wish to update
 - A USB-C data cable

This tutorial will walk you through the following steps:
 - Enumerate in bootloader mode
 - Check the bootloader version on the controller
 - Update the bootloader if it is outdated
 - Upload the new application firmware

 

#### Enumerating the bootloader

Holding down the mapmode button on the side of the controller while plugging in the USB-C cable will boot the device in bootloader mode. All of the LEDs on the user interface should display a dim red color. This means that the device booted successfully, but the host computer has not recognized the device yet. You can now release the mapmode button. Once the device is configured on the host computer, all of the LEDs turn green. On the host computer the Grid controller now shows up as a removable storage device named "GRID".

#### Checking the bootloader version
Once the controller succesfully enumerated as a removable storage device, you can check the version of the bootloader. If you browse the device you will find 3 files on it:
- CURRENT.UF2 is the binary image file of the current firmware
- INDEX.HTM is a readme file that redirects to this instruction page
- INFO_UF2.TXT contains the bootloader version and other basic information about the controller

Open INFO_UF2.TXT and compare the contents to the latest version quoted here:

```
UF2 Bootloader v3.3.0-6-g9262ab2-dirty SFHWRO
Model: Bootloader 20191211
Board-ID: SAMD51N20A-GRID
```

#### Updating the bootloader
Please verify the Bootloader version before before uploading a new firmware image to your controller. The bootloader is maintained in a separate repository:
[grid-uf2](https://github.com/intechstudio/grid-uf2/releases/tag/v4.3.3-8)
Download the bootloader image from the repository and unzip the archive. The bootloader binary is contained in a single update-bootloader***.uf2 file. Once the controller is enumerated in bootloader mode, copy the .uf2 image to the removable storage device called GRID. After a successful update, the controller will reboot. Unplug the USB cable and repeat this step for all of your Grid modules.

#### Updating the firmware
Download the firmware image from the repository and unzip the archive. The firmware binary is contained in the  grid_toplevel_release.uf2 file. Once the bootloader is enumerated, copy the new firmware image to the removable storage device called GRID. After a successful update, the controller will reset and boot the newly installed firmware, ready to use. Make sure to repeat this process for all of your Grid modules, to ensure that they are all running the latest firmware.
