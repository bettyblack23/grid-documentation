*Using this guide you'll be able to reliably disassemble your Grid module for repair or for using an Upgrade Kit.*

## What you'll need

The tools for this job are listed below, the whole process should not take more than 10 minutes.


- A Grid module, manufactured after May of 2023 (no visible logo on front panel);
- A Philips-type, size-1 screwdriver; 
- A clean, non-conductive surface you can comfortably work on.

## Disassembly

Follow the image descriptions for a quick and painless disassembly process.

<ImageLightbox imageSrc={img3} styling={'w-3/5'} citation={'First, start with unscrewing the 4 black screws in the corners of the module.'}/>



<ImageLightbox imageSrc={img4} styling={'w-3/5'} citation={'Carefully pull on the pot/fader/encoder caps (no need to remove buttoncaps) and they should come right off.'}/>


<ImageLightbox imageSrc={img5} styling={'w-3/5'} citation={'After removing all black screws and caps, you should be able to just simply lift off the aluminium panel, revealing the insides of the module.'}/>



<ImageLightbox imageSrc={img7} styling={'w-3/5'} citation={'Unscrew the 4 silver screws holding both the PCB and the plastic spacers in the case.'}/>



<ImageLightbox imageSrc={img8} styling={'w-3/5'} citation={'Gently lift up the PCB itself by pulling on one side or by lifting it through the hole in the main PCB.'}/>



<ImageLightbox imageSrc={img9} styling={'w-3/5'} citation={'Be careful not to lose your utility button!'}/>

## Repair of Interface PCB

Remove the faulty Interface PCB and replace it with a replacement one you received from Intech Studio support.

<ImageLightbox imageSrc={img10} styling={'w-3/5'} citation={"For an interface board repair remove the iterface PCBs carefully. They are flexible, but it's possible to break them if one's not careful."}/>





## Upgrade Kit

Using the upgrade kit just follow the disassembly process backwards, but be careful to only use the parts provided in the Upgrade Kit and not mix them with the old ones, as they are incompatible.

## Troubleshooting

Regarding things that may go wrong during disassembly:
- If a bronze nut falls out of the case or becomes loosened: try to put back in/hold it in place with a second screwdriver;
- If plastic scraps or residue fall out of the caps when removing them for the first time: after reassembly, check if the caps touch or scratch the front panel, if they do email us at support@intech.studio;
- If the copper connectors on the inner side of the interfacing PCBs become bent or deformed: don't be afraid to bend them back into place by hand.
