### Setting up Knot with Grid

Using Knot as a USB MIDI Host for connecting Grid with you hardware MIDI devices is straightforward. You'll need the following things to get started:
- **1x Knot** and its respective USB-C cable for power or a DC power adapter
- **1x Grid module** of your choice (-or more of course!) and its respective USB-C cable for power and data
- **1x MIDI cable**, for connecting Knot with the MIDI hardware device (either a 3.5mm TRS cable or a 5-pin DIN MIDI cable with a TRS adapter)

To connect the devices together:
- Knot plugged into a power source either through the "USB-C" port or the "DC IN" port
- Grid plugged into Knot through the "USB HOST" port
- the MIDI hardware device plugged into the "MIDI OUT" of Knot with a MIDI cable

To check if everything's working aas it should, look out for the LEDs on Knot. When Knot first receive ample power they'll light up purple for a second. When a USB device is connected it should be green with the occasional blip when a message is sent or received.
