The installer files for Mac OS are hosted on GitHub. Throughout the download process, your browser may prompt a warning. Choose to keep the file.

## Installation
By default, you can download the .dmg Disk Image installer. 

Mac OS may prompt an alert, depending on your Privacy Settings. In this case you must directly specify that you allow Grid Editor to be installed.

Once you are able to open the disk image, the installation takes few seconds.
