description: Reference Documentation for the lua functions used by Grid
---

Grid controllers run <b>lua</b> scripts for their configurations. It's a Turing complete system, meaning you can come up with unique workflow improvements utilizing Grid's tactile controls. The API for configurations aka <i>grid_protocol</i> used by Grid modules can be read in this reference manual. 

Lua is a script language, please <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html" rel="external" target="_blank" class="pb-0.5 border-b-2 border-blue-500">check out the official lua page</a> for correct syntax.

This manual is supposed to be used together with the [Wiki](/docs/wiki/introduction.md) section as some functions are explained there in more detail under their respective Action Block (containers that house one or more functions, conveniently grouped together).
