The ElseIf Block can be created inside an already existing If Block to specify a subspecific FALSE outcome, creating 3 logical outcomes.

Actions within the ElseIf condition will only run when the event trigger happens AND the condition specified in the text box of the ElseIf Block is TRUE AND the conditions specified within the If Block are FALSE.
