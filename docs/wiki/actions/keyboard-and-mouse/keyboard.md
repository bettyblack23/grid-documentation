With the use of a Keyboard Block Grid is able to send keystrokes to the host computer as a physical keyboard would. This is useful for creating keyboard shortcuts (like ctrl+v or pressing Space for transport in Ableton) or just for general productivity purposes (only one keypress for Excel to press F2, then type a function in and then move along to the next row).

The Keyboard Block contains an input field for keys. You can input your desired keystrokes here with the keyboard or by using the dropdown menu below the input field.

The Keyboard Block differentiates between button presses and releases, please define your keyboard messages accordingly.

The Keyboard Block layout can also differentiate between different languange layouts. At the moment En, Hu and De layouts are supported.

There is also a value of input delay, which changes how much time Grid will wait between sending out each keystroke message. You can add delays to your own message or just define the default one which will exist between each message by default. This delay is defined in miliseconds.
