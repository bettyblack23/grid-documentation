Comment blocks are used to create comments in Editor for creating notes and general comments. These comments are saved onto Grid when the configuration is stored.

Comments are useful for making notes about functionality within a configuration or naming parts of an Action Chain. But be careful, comments eat up the per Event [characterlimit](../../char-limit) of Grid configurations very quickly, so use them sparingly!
