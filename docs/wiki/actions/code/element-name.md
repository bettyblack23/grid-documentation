Element Name Blocks are used to name the Control Element configuration in Grid Editor. These names are stored with the configuration and therefore are saved in both Presets or when Store is pressed.

Element named are only visible when the little "eye" icon is clicked on the Grid Editor UI. Currently character count is very limited, use abbreviations when possible to keep within the [config character limit](../../char-limit).
