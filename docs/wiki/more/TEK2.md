#### Endless Encoder with Two Big Steel Knobs:
- Features two large steel knobs that provide a tactile and ergonomic feel.
- Designed to offer a comfortable grip and effortless rotation.
- Allows for smooth and precise adjustments with just one finger.
- Ensures durability and reliability, built for rigorous usage and long-term performance.


#### Differences between Encoders and Normal Potentiometers:
- Range of Motion: Encoders offer infinite rotation, while normal potentiometers have fixed endpoints.
- Digital vs. Analog Output: Encoders provide digital signals, while normal potentiometers offer analog output.
- Precision and Resolution: Encoders offer stepped rotation for precise adjustments, whereas potentiometers provide smooth and fine control.
