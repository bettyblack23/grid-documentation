<!---:::caution 
The control element preset sidebar is considered legacy feature from Grid Editor version 1.2.29 onward, and therefore no longer visible on the left sidebar!

Users wanting to utilize control element presets can still turn it back on under preferences!

It's possible to save a control element as a whole such as a button or fader as a local .JSON file on the computer running Grid Editor. This function can also create a saved version of the System Element as well.

This makes it easier to keep backed up versions of configurations you created, broken down into small parts for easy copy+paste action.

These elements are numbered as usual e.g. from 0 to 16 on a 16 element module such as an EN16.

0 to 15 here marks the regular control elements, and number 16 marks the system element, that houses the system events.
