It's possible to save a control element as a whole such as a button or fader as a local .JSON file on the computer running Grid Editor. This function can also create a saved version of the System as well.

This makes it easier to keep backed up versions of configurations you created, broken down into small parts for easy copy+paste action.

These elements are numbered as usual e.g. from 0 to 16 on a 16 element module such as an EN16.

0 to 15 here marks the normal control elements, and number 16 marks the system element, that houses the system events.
