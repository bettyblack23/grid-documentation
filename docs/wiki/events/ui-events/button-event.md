The Button Event is a UI Event, which means it triggers on user interaction. Specifically it triggers in two cases: when a button is pushed down and it "clicks" and when a button is released, these these type of triggers are called **Press and Release** in Grid terminology.

These button triggers and events are applicable to all encoders and buttons on a Grid module, aside form the utility button, which uses the [Utility Event](../system-events/utility-event).
