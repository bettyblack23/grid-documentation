Grid utilizes cool tech to let you achieve cool things. To ensure that you can use your modules for a long time, sometimes a bit of care can come a long way. For example, if the USB connection is unreliable or the connection between modules cuts out, start with cleaning the contacts (USB connector and gold pins on the side).

## What is in the box

Opening up the box, you will find your brand new Grid module inside. Each time we ship a package, we always pack the following things into ONE of the boxes: some stickers, one USB-C to A cable and one cleaning kit. Remember, not every box contains accessories.

- Stickers üòé
- USB C to A cable (High-Speed USB 2.0)
- Cleaning Kit - How and When to use it‚Ä¶

## :toolbox: Contents

The care package contains the following items:
- Alcohol wet-wipes
- Cleaning sticks
- Vial of electronic cleaner fluid

The electronic cleaner is suitable to remove manufacturing (soldering) residue from the connectors. Any electronic cleaning substance can be sufficient, for reference we strongly recommend the following: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=isopropyl+electronics+cleaner&ref=nb_sb_noss_2" style="color:rgb(97, 157, 255)" class="text-blue-500  cursor-pointer hover:underline">electronic cleaner</a>.
