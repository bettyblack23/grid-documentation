Grid Firmware is often updated. We introduce new features, stability improvements and bug fixes in each update. We highly recommend keeping your modules up-to-date, to ensure best performance and workflow compatibility. When you connect the modules while Grid Editor is running it will warn you if you are using an outdated firmware version.
